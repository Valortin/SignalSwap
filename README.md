# **What SignalSwap Does**

### 🔥 **Real-Time Market Intelligence**

Live price feeds, volume spikes, liquidity flows across the Aleo DeFi ecosystem — with privacy preserved by design.

### 🐋 **Whale Intelligence Engine**

Tracks Mega Whales → Whales → Dolphins → Fish with predictive intent scoring — using zk-verified data where needed.

### 🧠 **AI Trading Brain**

Hybrid on-chain/off-chain inference powering:

* Trade recommendations
* Risk/reward calculations
* Market regime detection

### 🌐 **SocialFi Layer**

Copy-trading, strategy sharing, performance scores, and community-validated trading signals — all with optional privacy.

### ⚡ **One-Click Execution**

Direct Aleo DEX + aggregator integrations for frictionless, private trading.

# **The Problem SignalSwap Solves**

Retail traders operate blind—unable to see whale moves, leaking sensitive data on public chains, and overpaying on centralized platforms.  
SignalSwap fixes this by offering:

* Sub-second decentralized intelligence
* Private, ultra-low cost execution on Aleo
* Transparent yet privacy-preserving, community-validated alpha

Turning Aleo into **the smartest private trading brain in crypto.**
